The goal of this exercise is to test your front-end development skills on this pre-defined project.

Don't stress if you can't get every part done -- spend a maximum of 4 hours on this assignment.
We'll discuss your solution in person so you'll get a chance to tell us what else you wanted to add and how you planned to implement those.

The main objective is that the code you submit is easy to understand, well-structured and works.

## Tasks

- Create a UI Component that filters the users by role
- Create a UI Component that hides the verified users
- Create a UI Component that orders the user list by name
- Create a component that does basic pagination
  - This component should contain 2 buttons (Prev, Next) which can paginate the user list
    on the client-side. The list should only show 5 elements at a time.
- Add a new input field on the UI to be able to change the role of a selected user.
- Write unit tests for every new code you write, preferably using Jest.

## Usage
 1. Download / clone this repository.
 2. Install dependencies.
 3. Run the start script.
 4. Happy Coding!
